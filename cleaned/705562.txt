        depletedsoul: Dam, my in car CD player has broke!, ive been
        forced to use the dreaded tape deck, gosh it sounds rubbish.
        Anyone wanna buy me a new cd changer?, cheers.
        Boonjam: tapes are shit
        ninav: i don't really like tapes but i gotta use them for
        french and german ¬_¬
        ratnerstar: Make sure you keep them separated or pretty soon
        all your tapes will be German.
