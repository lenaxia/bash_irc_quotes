        #961197 +(67)- [X]

        <DrBadAss>Lessee... the Republican party is in disarray,
        divided by an offshoot reactionary group, spearheaded by men
        who pander to the least common denominator and say and do the
        most ridiculous things imaginable, directly flaunting the
        Constitution, and proving on a daily basis they're incapable
        of compromise, and that their only goal is to take down their
        opponent at the expense of the country's welfare and proper
        operation.
        <DrBadAss>  We Democrats have a CLEAR shot at this.  It's
        going to be really interesting to see how we go about f#@%ing
        it up.
