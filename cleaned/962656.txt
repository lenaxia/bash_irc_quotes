        < Dustin> I was talking to a French friend earlier. He was
        annoyed that English didn't have a word for a specific kind of
        pride like French does. I pointed out that the French having
        more words for pride is like the Inuits having more words for
        snow.
        < Dustin> He didn't laugh. =[
