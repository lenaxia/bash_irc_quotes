        «+ GearSlayr » and my cat shits on the floor now too cause
        she's getting old
        «+ GearSlayr » if its not near a litter box it just shits. it
        did it on the stairs once and i slipped on it and almost broke
        my neck
        «+ GearSlayr » i'd love to kill that cat myself.
        «+ GearSlayr » fuck it, it'll have depends on or something
        «+ GearSlayr » thats what i'll do
        «+ GearSlayr » i'll tie a diaper to my cats ass
        «+ GearSlayr » or a bag or something
        «+ GearSlayr » can you picture that?
        «+ GearSlayr » that would be the most pathetic thing ever
        «+ NathanRomulus » your cat will sit and tear it off
        «+ GearSlayr » yeah probably
        «+ NathanRomulus » and then proceed to crap on your floor
        «+ GearSlayr » seriously though that cat needs to be put down
        «+ GearSlayr » its like 17 years old
        « syrup6 » wow
        « syrup6 » old as fart
        «+ GearSlayr » and damn... you'd think my dog could just drag
        its ass outside after it takes a shit... BUT NOOOOO
        «+ GearSlayr » i know just what my dog thinks... "how can i
        piss him off... i know.. i'll drag my ass right next to his
        computer so he HAS to clean up the skid mark!"
        «+ GearSlayr » longest skid mark that dog ever made was 12
        feet... it was so amazing i had to measure it
        «+ GearSlayr » i should've taken pictures
        «+ GearSlayr » it was fucking hilarious
