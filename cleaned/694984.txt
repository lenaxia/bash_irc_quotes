        <Amun> just bought a server
        <Amun> did a harddrive restore on it
        <Amun> found nothing of interest
        <Amun> except... his poems
        <Amun> let me recite a few
        <Amun> this one is called 'wishful thinking'
        <Amun> The money I ve blown
        <Amun> Getting high with dirty bitches I wish I ve never known
        <Amun> Puffin on the pipe while they choke on my bone
        <Amun> They re never grateful of the kindness I ve shown
        <Amun> Or of all the times I ve made them mown
        <Amun> So from now on I m just going to fucking leave them
        alone
