        รฐ Zibblsnrt waaahs. Freezing rain warnings still
        <rob`> that's gotta suck :P
        <Prophet4> it looks kinda cool though, with a layer of ice all
        over everything
        <Zibblsnrt> it sucks more after two days, when trees start
        collapsing
        <rob`> hey, the daffodils are sprouting.
        <Zibblsnrt> don't make me mail you a bomb in a container of
        Agent Orange
