        <Oceandream9>  On another note, they should create a word that
        doesn't mean horny, but just having the urge to cuddle.
        <Oceandream9>  Yeah, there's cuddly, but that's more of an
        adjective. I want the actual yearning to cuddle to become a
        word.
        <Oceandream9>  Can anybody think of one?
        <Combat_taco>  cundry
        <Thunder_cunt>  Cuddlesome?
        <Unpleasantries>  snugglish
        <Sm0t>   FEMALE
