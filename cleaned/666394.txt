        <BigMac> Omg, My dad s just died suddenly in hospital 
        <BigMac> I m gonna go see his corpse in the morgue 
        <Pleston> I doubt that.
        <BigMac> What?
        <Pleston> Well, firstly, any person would go see their father
        BEFORE mourning to us about it.
        <Pleaston> Secondly, I remember your other father dying about
        two weeks ago, on another chat.
        ** BigMac has quit (quit: Stfu)
        <Pleaston> Thought so
