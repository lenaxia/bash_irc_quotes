        ElGarlic: Spending your life waiting for the messiah to come
        save the world is like waiting around for the straight piece
        to come in Tetris.
        ElGarlic: Even if it comes, by that time you've accumulated a
        mountain of shit so high that you're fucked no matter what you
        do.
