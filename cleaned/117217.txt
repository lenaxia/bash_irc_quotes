        <Da_Wrecka> The guns cost £10. Considering the guns can be
        used in other games too that's not bad at all.
        <SLowry05> yeah wtf is that thing in front of hte numbers
        <Da_Wrecka> And it's still cheap.
        <Da_Wrecka> It's called a "pound sign"
        <SLowry05> oh you're chinese?
