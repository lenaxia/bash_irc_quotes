        <fishmunster123>  when i was younger, my dad got me this star
        wars trilogy cd set, thinkning it was the soundtracks.  it
        was, but it was all midi, no actual orchestra stuff
        <Norseman>  and that's how you learned to play the keyboard?
        <fishmunster123>  no, thats how i learned life is full of
        disappointments
