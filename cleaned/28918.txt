         8:08PM  <Shiznaz> for our senior prank we took about ten
        buckets of white oil paint and painted in 30 foot tall letters
        "GAY PRIDE" on the black tar shingle roof of out school
        <Shiznaz> I went to an all boy's school
        <Shiznaz> you could see the GAY PRIDE from blocks away
        <cornflake> lol
        <Shiznaz> they tried painting the white paint black so you
        wouldn't see it, but the shingles were more grey than
        anything, so it was just as easy to read
        <Shiznaz> I think they've just reshingled it since then
        <Huge_Spatula> I wish I went to an all boys school. All that
        fresh, untapped man ass
