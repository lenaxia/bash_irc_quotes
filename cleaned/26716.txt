        * ogw is zooming along at 650
        * ogw looks like that guy from the memorex commercials when
        he's sitting at his computer
        <fo0bar> is it live?
        <ogw> has anyone ripped that off yet?
        <ogw> or have I just predicted the next Dell campaign
        <ogw> "Is it dead?  Or is it DellÂ®?"
