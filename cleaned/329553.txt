        <Artemius> LONDON   Iran has established what could be the
        first training center for Islamic suicide attackers.
        <Treen> How does one train for a suicide bombing?
        <Traveler> It's indoctrination, plus training on how not to
        detonate prematurely, and how to get your payload safely to
        where you are supposed to explode. I'd imagine there's a fair
        amount of "not getting caught" training involved.
        <Sketchboy> So a lot like sex-ed?
