        <karlmex> So a friend of mine got back from Amsterdam a few
        months back, after spending a stint there with a bunch of his
        mates.  Told me quite possibly one of the funniest stories I 
        ve heard. They had picked up some shrooms and acid, and
        decided to take it in the wee hours of the morning, and spend
        the day exploring the city while they tripped sure enough
        20min into it, one of the group vanishes. So, after 7 or so
        hours of struggling to search for their lost friend, they
        decide it d be best to head back to their hotel, sober up,
        regroup, and go looking when the gears worn off and they d be
        of more use.
        <tubs> lol k
        <karlmex> Anyway, upon arrival at the hotel, surprise suprise
        they find their friend standing in the lobby, dazed and
        staring at the ceiling muttering to himself.  Understandably
        they were all pissed off with him for making them worry and
        bringing their trip down as a result of their half assed
        search. However all the friend can reply with is  this fucking
        town is full of gremlins!   They tried to calm him down and
        tell him that it was the acid making him hallucinate, to which
        he replied  I knew you d say that so I captured one and locked
        it in the bathroom  
        <tubs> lol?
        <karlmex> as you d expect they thought he was losing the plot,
        but he insisted they come to his room and look for themselves.
        So, they head to the room, and sure enough, the bathroom door
        is baracaded shut with chairs, lamps, mattress and the bed 
        they're getting a little worried now, so they cautiously move
        the furniture away and inch the door open 
        <tubs> and??
        <karlmex> ...Laying on the floor is a 10 year old kid with
        Down syndrome grinning ear to ear.
        <tubs> lol dude that's fucked up
        <karlmex> The mate had come across one of those outing groups
        or retarded kids - freaked out, balled up one of those poor
        little bastards carried him back to the room and locked him in
        the bathroom for proof 
        <tubs> lol god man
        <karlmex> anyway, luckily the kid had one of those ID cards
        saying  hi my name is Ted, I live at blah blah  lol so yea,
        took the poor kid to the lobby, called the cops and did a
        runner before they arrived lol.
